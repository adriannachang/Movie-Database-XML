# Movie-Database-XML

This is a movie database program created for my ICS4U class, making use of XML files and sorting. It was coded in Adobe Flash Actionscript.

Upon execution of the program, the user must select which account they would like to use (click on icon to select account). The account information is read from the XML file myXML_users.xml. The user will then be able to view all the movies in the database. Movie information is read from the XML file myXML.xml. By hovering over a particular movie icon, the user can view data pertaining to that movie. The user may also sort the movies according to certain criteria by clicking on the buttons located at the buttom of the screen.

CHALLENGES FACED:
The main challenge I faced with this project was trying to get the movie information to appear when the movie icon was hovered over. I also had a lot of problems with objects appearing stacked on top of each other; a lot of the time I thought that some of my objects weren't showing up, but it was really just that they were hidden under something else on the screen.

MOST PROUD OF:
I think that the final project was visually quite attractive; I was also proud of my addition of a personalized menu screen that allowed the user to select an account to use.
