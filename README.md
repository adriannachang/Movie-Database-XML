# Movie-Database-XML

This is a movie database program created for my ICS4U class, making use of XML files and sorting. It was coded in Adobe Flash Actionscript.

Upon execution of the program, the user must select which account they would like to use (click on icon to select account). The account information is read from the XML file myXML_users.xml. The user will then be able to view all the movies in the database. Movie information is read from the XML file myXML.xml. By hovering over a particular movie icon, the user can view data pertaining to that movie. The user may also sort the movies according to certain criteria by clicking on the buttons located at the buttom of the screen.
